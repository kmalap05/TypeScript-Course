# Introduction 🚀

**JavaScript with Superpowers:**
TypeScript is like a more powerful version of JavaScript. It enables you to do everything that JavaScript does, while adding extra features to simplify the process of writing larger and more complex programs.

# Installation 💻

## TypeScript Setup for Windows 🖥️

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm 📦

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Download them from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).

### Step 2: Install TypeScript globally 🌐

Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

This command installs TypeScript globally on your system.

### Step 3: Install ts-node globally 🚀

Run the following command to install ts-node globally:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

### Step 4: Create a TypeScript file 📄

Create a TypeScript file (e.g., app.ts) and write some TypeScript code. For example:

```typescript
// app.ts
const message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
console.log(message);
```

### Step 5: Run the TypeScript file using ts-node 🏃

Execute the TypeScript file using ts-node. In the command prompt or PowerShell, run the following command:

```bash
ts-node app.ts
```

This command compiles and executes the TypeScript file using ts-node.

That's it! You now have a basic **TypeScript setup** with ts-node globally on your **Windows system**. Continue developing your TypeScript applications by creating more files, installing additional dependencies, and leveraging TypeScript features. Happy coding! 🌈
