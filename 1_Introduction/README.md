# Introduction

**JavaScript with Superpowers:**
TypeScript is like a more powerful version of JavaScript. It lets you do everything that JavaScript does, but it adds some extra features to make your life easier when writing larger and more complex programs.

# Installation

## TypeScript Setup for Windows

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: Node.js Downloads.

### Step 2: Install TypeScript globally

Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and run the following command to install TypeScript globally:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

This will install TypeScript globally on your system.

### Step 3: Install ts-node globally

Run the following command to install ts-node globally:

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

### Step 4: Create a TypeScript file

Create a TypeScript file (e.g., app.ts) and write some TypeScript code. For example:

```
// index.ts
const message: string = 'Hello, TypeScript!';
console.log(message);
```

### Step 5: Run the TypeScript file using ts-node

Run the TypeScript file using ts-node. In the command prompt or PowerShell, run the following command:

```
ts-node index.ts
```

This command will compile and execute the TypeScript file using ts-node.

That's it! You now have a basic **TypeScript setup** with ts-node globally on your **Windows system**. You can continue to develop your TypeScript applications by creating more files, installing additional dependencies, and using TypeScript features.
